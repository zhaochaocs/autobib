Autobib
=======

Forked from the [Autobib](https://github.com/jdumas/autobib) project by @jdumas. Please look at the original project first for installation and usage.



A new feature is added to load paper titles from the text file directly rather than pdf files. Just create an extra `paper_list.txt` file to your pdf file repository, and put one title per line without the `.pdf` extension, and then everything would work as before. I also remove the semicolons from the original bibkey format, which made it difficult to select the whole bibkey by double click.
